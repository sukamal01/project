## General info
CAPM is the model that describes the relationship between the expected return and risk of securities
S&P500 is being used as benmark index.
Stock prices of 8 stocks has been considered from January 2012 to April 2020

python's plotly.express for interactive chart

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.9
* IDE - Jupyter notebook


## Setup
Use "!pip install 'module' for necessary packages in Jupyter cell
i.e : !pip install plotly

## Code Examples
Calculating Daily return
# Function to calculate the daily returns 
def daily_return(df):
  df_daily_return = df.copy()
    # Loop through each stock
  for i in df.columns[1:]:
    # Loop through each row belonging to the stock
    for j in range(1, len(df)):
      # Calculate the percentage of change from the previous day
      df_daily_return[i][j] = ((df[i][j]- df[i][j-1])/df[i][j-1]) * 100
    # set the value of first row to zero, as previous value is not available
    df_daily_return[i][0] = 0
  return df_daily_return

Calculate beta and alpha
Example:
beta:
{'AAPL': 1.1128924148678099,
 'AMZN': 0.9917345712576846,
 'BA': 1.3828672010892775,
 'GOOG': 1.034881768742856,
 'IBM': 0.9604149148095245,
 'MGM': 1.653567706518011,
 'T': 0.7446293454747844,
 'TSLA': 1.2686150101095908}
------

To-do list:
* I have used equal weights for the portfolio, can be optimized further with monte carlo simulation
